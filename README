Web.erl

 By Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.pp.se>

What is it?
-----------
Like web.py (http://webpy.org), but for erlang.


How do I start?
---------------
An example project is weberltest.erl. You can run it by going into the
src dir and running "make run".

The library functionality isn't very far along yet, but the example
project is how I evision it.


How can I help?
---------------
* Package it
* Make it work with FastCGI
* Make it work with built-in webservers (yaws or something)
