Web.erl

 By Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.pp.se>

What is it?
-----------
Like web.py (http://webpy.org), but for erlang.


How do I start?
---------------
An example project is weberltest.erl. You can run it by going into the
src dir and running "make run".

The library functionality isn't very far along yet, but the example
project is how I evision it.

How can I help?
---------------
In order of importance:
* Make it work with FastCGI
* Template system (see template section of this file)
* Package it
* Make it work with built-in webservers (yaws or something)

Templates
---------
Templates are compiled into erlang code and included into the handler module.

Erlang code doesn't work well for discreet inline code, so the
templating language is more like that of web.py.

    $def with (menuitems, year)
    <ul>
    $for (item,foo) in menuitems:
      <li>$item $foo</li>
    </ul>

This template is then called with myTemplate([{foo, bar}], 2009).

myTemplate_loop1([], S) ->
  S;
myTemplate_loop1(L, S) ->
  [H|T] = L,
  {A,B} = H,
  S2 = S ++ "<li>" ++ A ++ " " ++ B ++ "</li>",
  myTemplate_loop1(T, S).
myTemplate(Parm1, Parm2) ->
  "<ul>" ++ myTemplate_loop1(Parm1, "") ++ "</ul>".

(the templating language is not implemented yet. So the design is not final)

License
-------
I'm thinking BSD license. Maybe public domain since that's what web.py
uses. Nothin settled yet.
