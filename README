Web.erl

 By Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.pp.se>

What is it?
-----------
Like web.py (http://webpy.org), but for erlang.


How do I start?
---------------
An example project is weberltest.erl. You can run it by going into the
src dir and running "make run".

The library functionality isn't very far along yet, but the example
project is how I evision it.


How can I help?
---------------
In order of importance:
* Make it work with FastCGI
* Template system
* Package it
* Make it work with built-in webservers (yaws or something)

License
-------
I'm thinking BSD license. Maybe public domain since that's what web.py
uses. Nothin settled yet.
